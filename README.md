# Hyprscroller

[Hyprscroller](https://github.com/86kkd/hyprscroller) is a
[Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) layout plugin that creates a window layout
similar to [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM).

![Intro](./videos/hyprscroller.gif)

The plugin is quite feature complete and supports gaps, borders, special workspace, scroller-managed fullscreen expansion, overview, marks and installation through `hyprpm`.

This plugin is maintained against the Hyprland versions I actually run and test. The focus is practical compatibility with packaged Hyprland releases first, instead of chasing trunk continuously.

## Requirements

_hyprscroller_ supports the version of _Hyprland_ I use, which should be the same as the Arch Linux `hyprland` package. You can try your luck with the latest `git` changes, but I will be slower to keep up with those, as there are too many API changes going on upstream.

## Building and installing

With Hyprland installed it should be as simple as running

```sh
# builds a shared object hyprscroller.so
make all
# installs the shared library in ~/.config/hypr/plugins
make install
```

If you are hacking on the plugin, you can also run the pure logic tests without
starting Hyprland:

```sh
cmake -S . -B Debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build ./Debug -j
ctest --test-dir ./Debug --output-on-failure
```

For compositor-level regressions after touching canvas or lane hot paths, run
the manual [smoke test checklist](./docs/smoke-test-checklist.md) as well.

A more automated option is to use `hyprpm`.

```sh
hyprpm add https://github.com/86kkd/hyprscroller
# verify it installed correctly
hyprpm list
```

You can enable or disable it via `hyprpm enable hyprscroller` and
`hyprpm disable hyprscroller`.

## Configuration

If you are not using `hyprpm`, to make Hyprland load the plugin, add this to
your configuration.

```conf
plugin = ~/.config/hypr/plugins/hyprscroller.so
```

Instead, if you use `hyprpm`, it should be as simple as adding this to
your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` :

```conf
exec-once = hyprpm reload -n
```

To turn on the layout, use

```conf
general {
    ...

    layout = scroller

    ...
}
```

## Dispatchers

The plugin adds the following dispatchers:

| Dispatcher                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Fullscreen behavior

`scroller:togglefullscreen` is not the same as Hyprland's native
`fullscreen/fullscreenstate` dispatchers.

- In _row_ mode, it expands the active column horizontally so the focused
  window becomes as wide as a single-window workspace.
- In _column_ mode, it expands the active window vertically so it becomes as
  tall as a single-window workspace.
- It stays inside scroller's layout model, so focus movement and scrolling
  behavior continue to work normally.

## Modes

_Hyprscroller_ works in one of two modes that can be changed at any moment.

1. _row_ mode: it is the default. It creates new windows in a new column.
   `cyclesize` affects the width of the active column. `alignwindow` aligns
   the active column according to the argument received. `fitsize` fits the
   selected columns to the width of the monitor.

2. _column_ mode: It creates new windows in the current column, right below the
   active window. `cyclesize` affects the height of the active window.
   `alignwindow` aligns the active window within the column, according to the
   argument received. `fitsize` fits the selected windows in the column to the
   height of the monitor.

## Window/Column Focus and Movement

If you want to use _Hyprscroller_ you will need to map your key bindings from
the default `movefocus`/`movewindow` to
`scroller:movefocus`/`scroller:movewindow`. The reason is _Hyprland_ doesn't
have the concept (yet) of a workspace that spans more than the space of a
monitor, and when focusing directionally, it doesn't look for windows that are
"outside" of that region. If this changes in the future, these two dispatches
may become obsolete.

`movefocus` and `movewindow` accept the following directional arguments:
`l` or `left`, `r` or `right`, `u` or `up`, `d` or `dn` or `down`, `b` or
`begin` or `beginning`, `e` or `end`. So you can focus or move windows/columns
in a direction or to the beginning or end or the row.

## Resizing

`cyclesize` accepts an argument which is either `+1`/`1`/`next`, or
`-1`/`prev`/`previous`. It cycles forward or backward through three column
widths (in _row_ mode): one third, one half or two thirds of the available
width of the monitor. In _column_ mode, the fractions are relative to the
height of the monitor, and are: one third, one half, two thirds or one.
However, using `resizewindow`, you can modify the width or height of
any window freely.

## Aligning

Columns are generally aligned in automatic mode, always making the active one
visible, and trying to make at least the previously focused one visible too if
it fits the viewport, if not, the one adjacent on the other side. However, you
can always align any column to the _center_, _left_ or _right_ of the monitor
(in _row_ mode), or _up_ (top), _down_ (bottom) or to the _center_ in _column_
mode. For example center a column for easier reading, regardless of what happens to
the other columns. As soon as you change focus or move a column, the alignment
is lost.

`alignwindow` takes a parameter: `l` or `left`, `r` or `right`, `c` or
`center` or `centre`, `u` or `up` and `d` or `down`.

To use _right_ or _left_ you need to be in _row_ mode, and to use _up_ or
_down_ in _column_ mode. _center_ behaves differently depending on the mode.
In _row_ mode it aligns the active column to the center of the monitor. In
_column_ mode, it aligns the active window within its column, to a centered
position.

## Admit/Expel

You can create columns of windows using `admitwindow`. It takes the active
window and moves it to the column left of its current one, right under the
active window in that column.

To expel any window from its current column and position it in a new column to
its right, use `expelwindow`.

## Fitting the Screen

When you have a ultra-wide monitor, one in a vertical position, or the default
column widths or window heights don't fit your workflow, you can use manual
resizing, but it is sometimes slow and tricky.

`scroller:fitsize` works in two different ways, depending on the active mode.

It allows you to re-fit the columns (_row_ mode) or windows (_column_ mode) you
want to the screen extents. It accepts an argument related to the
columns/windows it will try to fit. The new width/height of each column/window
will be proportional to its previous width or height, relative to the other
columns or windows affected.

1. `active`: It is similar to maximize, it will fit the active column/window.
2. `visible`: All the currently fully or partially visible columns/windows will
   be resized to fit the screen.
3. `all`: All the columns in the row or windows in the column will be resized
   to fit.
4. `toend`: All the columns or windows from the focused one to the end of the
   row/column will be affected.
5. `tobeg` or `tobeginning`: All the columns/windows from the focused one to
   the beginning of the row/column will now fit the screen.

## Overview

`scroller:toggleoverview` toggles a bird's eye view of the current workspace where
all the windows are scaled to fit the current monitor. You can still interact
with them normally (change focus, move windows, type in them etc.). When
toggling back to normal mode, the original window sizes will be restored...so
it is not wise to use _toggleoverview_ for window resizing or creating new windows.
Use it as a way to see where things are and move the active focus, or a window,
anything beyond that will probably find bugs or **cause compositor crashes**.

## Marks

You can use _marks_ to navigate to frequently used windows, regardless of
which workspace they are in (it even works for the special workspace windows).

`scroller:marksadd` adds a named mark. Use a _submap_ to create bindings for
several named marks you may want to use. See the configuration example for
directions.

`scroller:marksdelete` deletes a named mark created with `scroller:marksadd`.

`scroller:marksvisit` moves the focus to a previously created mark.

`scroller:marksreset` clears all marks.

Marks reference windows, but are global, they may belong to different
workspaces, so visiting a mark may switch workspaces.

You can use any string name for a mark, for example in scripts. But they are
also very convenient to use with regular key bindings by simply using a letter
as the name. Again, see the example configuration.

## Options

_hyprscroller_ currently accepts the following options:

1. `column_default_width`: determines the width of new columns in _row_ mode.
   Possible arguments are: `onehalf` (default), `onethird`, `twothirds`,
   `maximized`, `floating` (uses the default width set by the application).

2. `focus_wrap`: determines whether focus will _wrap_ when at the first or
   last window of a row/column. Possible arguments are: `true`|`1` (default), or
   `false`|`0`.

For example:

```conf
plugin {
    scroller {
        column_default_width = onehalf
        focus_wrap = false
    }
}
```

## Key bindings

As an example, you could set some key bindings in your `hyprland.conf` like this:

```conf
# Move focus with mainMod + arrow keys
bind = $mainMod, left, scroller:movefocus, l
bind = $mainMod, right, scroller:movefocus, r
